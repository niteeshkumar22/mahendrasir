              Subhash Chandra Foundation is working to improve the living
              conditions of socially and economically backward communities
              through its Village Development Program. Various strategic
              interventions in the space of education, health, agriculture and
              sports are undertaken to ensure holistic development of villages.
              Some of the key initiatives under health intervention includes
              facilitating development of a government hospital in the targeted
              village and creating awareness among the community on health and
              sanitation issues. Agriculture development also forms an integral
              part of the village development program and, the foundation is
              actively engaged to address agricultural challenges and improve
              agricultural productivity in the targeted villages. The foundation
              also provides organic fertilizers to the farmer community with an
              objective to promote organic farming and sustainable farm
              practices.

              A total of 161 farmers have been so far associated with this
              sustainable agriculture intervention. The foundation promotes and
              organizes various sports activities in the villages to attract
              children and youth towards the importance of physical fitness.
              Under this initiative, the foundation provides sports training &
              learning opportunity through community volunteers in the villages.

              program organized in the village in Hisar district, Haryana, out
              of which 3 girls from the village were also awarded with silver
              and gold medals in the district and state level tournament. These
              sports activities are changing the perspective of the village
              community towards relevance of sports and also empowering girls to
              come forth to participate in these activities leading to an
              unbiased environment. The foundation is also facilitating the
