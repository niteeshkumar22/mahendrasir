He/she wants oxygen The want starts with the breath, then water, then milk, food and then it keeps growing day by day. The cycle of want keeps growing throughout the life.

        description:"The separation with anyone we love leaves a bad feeling in our lives. Such separation may be due to any misunderstanding between individuals or due to people living in different geographies or due to death. An in-depth realization comes only when one accepts the reality. Once we accept the reality of that moment and then we start analysing, we will come to know that more attachment we have with each other, the more we suffer. It is also a function of our expectations from the person we love, more the expectation more the suffering on separation. We as a human, we start building expectations from the time when the would-be child (son or a daughter) is conceived and have yet nine months to take birth. We start building an imaginary vision for the loved ones and if that vision is not fulfilled, our so-called heart is broken, and we suffer. The death of the loved one is anycase very painful. Hence loosing loved ones is a suffering.",

        description1 :"Since childhood one aspires to become someone, we want to get lots of money, attain success, wanting a perfect and comfortable lifestyle. When one achieves this, he becomes very joyful & he works very hard for getting more and more and more. But the moment he loses it he gets miserable. We have heard that nothing is permanent, but we always feel that the good times we have will be permanent. The law of the nature is “Nothing in life is permanent” We humans want good time to be permanent and want the bad times to go away quickly. When it doesn't happen the way we want, we lose the balance of our mind. We suffer because of things not happening according to our wants.",
